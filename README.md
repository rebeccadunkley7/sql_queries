Here you can find a selection of queries indexed by technical sql used within the code. 

This repository is designed to offer a quick glance at my sql capabilities with a selection of scripts. A brief overview has been provided at the start of each query with a theoretical scenario and use case for the output of each query. ALl queries have a specific business question they are designed to answer, with the outputs directed by a clear commercial desicion or use case.
